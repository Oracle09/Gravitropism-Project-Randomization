# Define the setup parameters
time_points <- c(0, 30, 120, 360) # in minutes
groups <- c("Treatment", "Control")
biological_replicates <- 1:3 #3 replicates per time point
plates_per_replicate <- 15   # 15 plates makes a replicate. Each plate contains 13 seedlings. This last info is irrelevant
total_plates <- length(time_points) * length(groups) * length(biological_replicates) * plates_per_replicate #(I have not accounted for general baseline)

# Create a dataframe representing all the plates in the experiment
experiment_setup <- expand.grid(
  TimePoint = time_points,
  Group = groups,
  BiologicalReplicate = biological_replicates,
  PlateNumber = 1:plates_per_replicate
) %>% 
  mutate(BatchID = 1:n())


## Adjust for the single baseline representative: 
# Remove extra baseline entries and adjust total plate count
experiment_setup <- experiment_setup %>% 
  filter(!(TimePoint == 0 & Group == "Control")) %>%
  mutate(TotalPlates = n())

# Randomize the order of the plates to minimize batch effects
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
experiment_setup <- experiment_setup[sample(nrow(experiment_setup)), ]

# Assign plates to batches based on my 20 apparatus limit
apparatus_limit <- 20
experiment_setup$BatchAssignment <- ceiling(seq(1, nrow(experiment_setup)) / apparatus_limit)


# Calculate the start day for each batch, assuming each batch runs for 8 days
experiment_setup$StartDay <- (experiment_setup$BatchAssignment - 1) * 8 + 1   #I will explain the logic behind this

#This is to ensure that each batch runs for 8 days interval
#For Batch 1: (1 - 1) * 8 + 1 = 1, indicating it starts on day 1, which is correct.
#For Batch 2: (2 - 1) * 8 + 1 = 9, indicating it starts on day 9, exactly 8 days after batch 1, 
# which aligns with the requirement that each batch runs for 8 days before the next batch begins.

#Sort by Batch Assignment 
a <- experiment_setup %>% arrange(experiment_setup$BatchAssignment)   ###this is redundant. Batch assignment is already sorted (hahahah)

# To Count occurrences of each ID within each BatchAssignment
b<- a %>%
