Refer to the ppicture uploaded above. 
Protein samples will be collected at 7 time points (treatment and control) x 3 replicates = 21 total samples
15 plates will make a single sample = 315 total plates required
I have just 20 apparatus to run the project at a time.

This will give a:
Control group = 135
Treatment group = 135    + 45 baseline
